# Coding Competitions Problems Solutions

This repository contains problems solutions from course:
- [How to Win Coding Competitions: Secrets of Champions](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:ITMOx+I2CPx+3T2017/course/)

> **Warning**
> This repository contains full solutions of the problems. So, if you are taking the course **DON'T SEE** the solution until you have finished all the problems of the week.

The purpose of this repository is the possibility of any interested person being able to compare their solutions with mine.
So, if you find a solution shorter and/or faster than any of mine. Feel free to contact me.
